### 1. What is Chat Engine?
* Chat Engine is a set of frontend and backend components to make building chat experiences easy.
* On the frontend, we provide Components, Sockets and Hooks to add chat features into any website.
* On the backend, we provide a hosted chat Server which you can connect your frontend to.

### 2. Why use Chat Engine?
* All the data-storage, hosting, scaling and computing has been abstracted into Chat Engine's Chat Servers.
* This means that you don't have to maintain any backend code while adding Chat into your app.
* When you setup a Project on chatengine you get your own Chat Server instance.
